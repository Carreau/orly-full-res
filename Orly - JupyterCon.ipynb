    "control. When defining a class, the code author needs to define a number of methods which should return the `(data, metadata)` pair for a given object mimetype. If no metadata is necessary, these can be omitted. For some common representations, short method names are available. These methods can be recognized as they all follow the following pattern: `_repr_*_(self)`. That is to say, an underscore, followed by `repr` followed by an underscore. The star `*` needs to be replaced by a lowercase identifier often referring to a short human readable description of the format (e.g.: `png` , `html`, `pretty`, ...). Finish with a single underscore. We note that unlike the python `__repr__` (pronounced \"Dunder rep-er\" which starts and ends with two underscores, the \"Rich reprs\" or \"Reprs-stars\" start and end with a _single_ underscore."
